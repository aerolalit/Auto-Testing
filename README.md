What does it do!!!=======================This script automatizes the job of TAs who grade the programming task of students.This script is designed to test python porgrammes only.How do I use it ?--------------------First write all the std input of the programs in files named as `Testcase.txt, Testcase1.txt, Testcase2.txt,.. and so on.`Then, place all the sub-directories containing the files that needs to be graded inside a directory called `data`Then, you are ready to go. Now the following single command will do the job.	bash test.shAll the std output produced by each student programms againgst each test case will be automatically documented in `output.out` file by the script .Since the student might print some instructional information like `Enter the data:` or debug statements along with the computed values that need to be tested, the output values should be checked manually. In case of strict format for the stdout, the number of passed testcasses can be comuted and grades can calculated using some function.License: see `LICENSE.md`---------------------------------![alt text](https://github.com/aerolalit/Auto-Testing-Python-Programs/blob/master/images/script%20running.png)![alt text](https://github.com/aerolalit/Auto-Testing-Python-Programs/blob/master/images/output.png)
